# Day 8

Everytime I think I learned everything..I learn that I know absolutely nothing.

Sometimes altough I think the obvious first step is to go on Google reverse search...it doesn't work.
Which is how I lost a looot of time in this challenge.

So based on the text given, the special day of celebration for all Lyon residents is *La fête des lumières* or *The celebration of lights*.

I looked everywhere online but I could find nothing and to be honest, the dumbest way to find the answers is sometimes the best.

I just typed the text of the image exactly as it was written on the picture:

*"3 jours de chance chaque semaine. Venez tous Rue Victor Hugo"*

I found an article* written by the newspaper *Le Progrès*.

The original picture from 1974 shows a truck with a bunch of Christmas trees and indeed this is the answer.

The description says that if you went to Rue Victor Hugo, you could win a christmas tree!

Answer : **Sapin**

Now, to find the city where the Christmas tree was located, I had to dig through the newspaper archives...unfortunately finding the archives for the year 1924 is a little bit hard when looking only through the specific newspaper.

So I decided to use another tool that a lot of archivists and historians use : **Gallica**.

Thanks to Gallica*, I managed to find the edition of *Le Progrès* from the 25th of December.

Thanks to the description underneath the picture, I found that the Christmas Tree was located in **Copenhagen**.

**Ranking : 126/325**
