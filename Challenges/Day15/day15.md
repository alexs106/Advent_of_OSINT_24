# Day 15

This challenged showed me that although some information seems private, it can actually be found if you look hard enough.

I started by looking business licenses for the state of Arizona. From there I found a bunch of databases with a lot of business licenses but none for **Excalibur Asset Solutions**. Problem is I read the nale wrong at first so I was looking for the wrong type of license but eventually found the right database*.

The license number is **LC639729000**.
