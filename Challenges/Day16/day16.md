# Day 16

Okay so this was one of my favourites.

At first I thought that I would have to find the car on Google Street View or something but then I realised (after reading a bit slower) that the registration number was given so no need.

This is another example of information that I would assume is private but apparently it's not.

So I just looked up *"Sweedish vin number"* and found a website* that asks for the registration number of a car and gives you the vin number.
