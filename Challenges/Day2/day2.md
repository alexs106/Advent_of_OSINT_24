# Day 2

Okay so, day 2 didn't look too hard especially because there were 4 pictures in one collage so I thought if I couldn't find the source from just one picture, I had 3 more to help me out.

After doing image reverse search on the collage, I immediately found a website describing it as the **Scène de la Nativité VRSA in Vila Real de Santo Antonio.**

I then search in the website for the clue word "pièces" and immediately found the answer : **+5000 pieces** 

Problem is... I once again didn't read the question correctly where it clearly stated that it wanted the number of pieces for the **2023** set.

So I went back to google and found this link* that gave me my answer : **5800 figures**

I entered the answer and I was happy it didn't take too long :)
