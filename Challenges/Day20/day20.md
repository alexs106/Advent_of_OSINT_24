# Day 20

Day 20 reminded me that sometimes as hard as you look, you need to be able to read between the lines and not take the vocabulary literally.

I looked everywhere but couldn't find the exact calendar that the challenge was refering to. 

Eventually I looked up *"Calendar Saint Priapre"* and found my answer: **Calendrier Pataphysique*** where the creator uses both mythological and religious figures as saints.

I looked online to find a calculator regarding the exact date and found this github repo :
