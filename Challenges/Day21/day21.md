# Day 21

Day 21 makes me kinda mad because I knew the answer immediately. Unfortunately, I was busy when the challenge started so I couldn't answer until 10 minutes later but I'm sure I could've answered faster.

Anyways the answer is easy, it comes from an old Mayan legend that said the world was going to end on **December 21st 2012** or **20121221**.
