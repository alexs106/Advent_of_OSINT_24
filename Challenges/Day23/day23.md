# Day 23

Day 23 I was busy so I started really late.

We have an NFT* and we need to find the owner of it.

I had no idea where to start so I looked online.

There where a lot of links telling you how to look but it seemed too complicated so I did an Image Reverse Search and found a Twitter account specialised in these NFT's:
**@BaseballheadNFT**

Although this helped, it would take too long to look through all the tweets so I went on another path.

Now I went to a ntf selling website* and started looking for our specific ntf based on the token: **#877** and the name of our creator : **BaseballHead**

Now when you go on the website it shows a bunch of information including the current holder :
**ahopkins.eth** aka **Anthony Hopkins**.

**Ranking : 137/194**
