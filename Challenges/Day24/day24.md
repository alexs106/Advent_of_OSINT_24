# Day 24

The final day. The big day.

Started off pretty ...I would say easy but honestly finding the person in the picture was hard.

We had a picture of when a treaty was being signed.
The last person to sign it appears on the picture but for the life of me,
I couldn't find him with reverse search or looking for a timeline of who signed it.

So I started from the beginning.

The treaty was signed 10 years ago, so that means around 24th of December 2014.

I looked up which treaties were signed around that time in the UN and found a very important one:
**The Arms Trade Treaty**

After looking for some sort of official document including dates of when countries signed it I found a link*
that led me to some very interesting data.

Problem is, I kept getting mixed up with the date of signature and the date of approval/ratification.

Eventually, I found that the last country to *ratify* the treaty was **South Africa**.

Now I thought that it was heads of state who signed treaties but turns out that at the time, it wasn't the case for South Africa,
so that made my job a bit harder.

I couldn't find the name of the specific person who signed it until I entered the UN's treaty archives.

In the archives, they have **Photos of Treaty Ceremonies**.
I filtered the photos to find the one I was looking for and found this:

Aka the exact picture that I was looking for and it came with a description:

*H.E. Mr. Jeremiah Nyamane Kingsley Mamabolo Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Permanent Representative of South Africa*

https://treaties.un.org/Pages/PhotoList.aspx?clang=_en

So the answer was **Mamabolo**

Second part was the registration number of the treaty being signed.
Now this was easy because I already had all of the information regarding the treaty based on my previous research*.

*https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetails.aspx?src=treaty&mtdsg_no=xxvi-8&chapter=26&clang=_en

The registration number was **52373**.

Now the third part of the task was also easy because I had found the name of the woman on the picture before that of the man's during my research for the first part.

Her name is **Arancha Hinojal Oyarbide** as written in this article* found thanks to an image reverse search using the picture from part 1.

Now the final part was a tricky one but a classic OSINT challenge, which makes it the best.

I had to find a **prestigous prize** in which Mr. Mamabolo served on the first committee of, only a couple of months after the treaty was signed so somewhere around beginning **2015**.

The prize is **The Nelson Mandela Prize**.

The first woman to have been awarded this prize was **Helena Ndume**.

Now regarding the documentary, I started thinking on a channel specializing in *explorations and natural history*
and started looking for **National Geographic** documentaries from 2016 regarding **Helena Ndume**.

I found this one* where she translates her second name during minute **1:20** as:
**I am better off**.
