# Day 4

This is the first challenge that didn't involve a picture and image reverse search so there's that.

Basically, the problem talked about the "Cour des comptes" in France (kinda like GAO for my American friends)

I had to look into the first report about the finances of "Téléthon" because apparently there were some concerns regarding intermediary organiwations or associations.

I had to find the initial value, the final value and calculate by how much the trend has increased as a percentage.

So first off, I went into the Cour des comptes' website and looked up any documents regarding "Téléthon".

Problem is, I kept finding documents from most recent years and definitely not the oldest one...

Eventually I managed to find the document from 1993*, I searched inside the document for the key phrase "orgénismes relais" anf ound a table with data but before that, there was a paragraph stating some tendencies changes between 1988 and 1993 so I figured this is where I had to look.

I found that the percentages went from **40%** in 1988 to **34%** in 1993 which makes a decrease of (40-34)/40 = **15%** !

**Ranking : 36/473**
