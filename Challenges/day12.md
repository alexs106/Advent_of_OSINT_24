# Day 12

Day 12 is a really good example on why AI can't solve OSINT challenges like humans can.

Okay so the first part of the problem asks for a major agreement adopted on December 12th 2014 aka **The Paris Agreement**.

Now I had to find where the agreement was adopted in Paris and I found, after a bit of research that it was adopted in **Le Bourget**. 
Now I know that there is a very famous museum there because I visited it last January and it's name is : **Mus√©e de l'Air et de l'Espace**.

A quick look at the museum map and we can find that upon entering the museum, the room directly in front of us is the **Salle des Huit Colonnes**.

Now second part was trickier, especially because I followed the wrong lead for like 30 minutes.

I thought that one of the aircrafts they referred to was **The Concorde**, very famous for its travels between Paris and **New York** but I was wrong. Although it is part of the museum's collection, it's not the aircraft we were looking for.

Sometimes the obvious choice isn't the right one...

After some more search and a deep reflexion on the vocabulary of the question I found that it had to be two different aircrafts that didn't make the trip back.

One of the aircrafts is **The Spirit of St. Louis** with a horsepower of **223**.
The second one is **Le Breguet 19** with a horsepower of **650**.

So the difference of horsepower between both of them is **427**.

The difficulty here was finding the right horsepower because depending on the source, the values might differ.

**Ranking : 88/323**
