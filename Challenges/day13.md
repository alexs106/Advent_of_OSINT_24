# Day 13

Okay I must preface this by saying that I didn't solve this challenge in the usual way...

The premise is that on December 13th 1940 there was a newspaper of a major city in the south of France that reported an avalanche had occurred in the Alps a few days before.

A national road was cut off, I needed to find the **number of that road**.

Problem is...I looked everywhere. I looked for the date, I looked for avalanches I looked for everything.

Maybe there was a more conventional answer to this and that is most likely the case but after a lot of time looking in every source I decided to see this problem in another way.

I looked up every national route around the Alps in the 1940s. Also from my failed research I found that the major city was most likely **Grenoble** so I looked up national routes around Grenoble and eventually found the right answer:

**Route nationale 91**

I still haven't been able to find the actual avalanche or maybe it wasn't an avalanche at all but a battle named "Avalanche", it remains a mystery to me.
