# Day 14

Day 14 is the reason why you should always look for sources.

It was a cute challenge, based on an image of Snoop Dogg so that means : image reverse search.

Well I did just that but I didn't think to find the official source of the photo until a couple minutes later.

It came from Getty Images* and the description of the photo said what song was playing when he came on stage:

**Santa Baby**
