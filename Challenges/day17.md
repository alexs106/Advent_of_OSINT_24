# Day 17

Day 17 was tough, I'm not going to lie.

So the first controlled flight was **The 1903 Wright Flyer** by the Wright brothers.

I spent hours looking for the people present during the flight and kept thinking the answer was one of the brothers but it wasn't. I lost a lot of time because of this.

Eventually I managed to find a website* detailling all people present during the time of the flight including **Willis Dough** who is hardly mentioned in most history websites but this one.

Now, based on some general knowledge, usually when a plaque is installed, the date is engraved in it as well, so all I had to find was a photo of the plaque. Just by googling it real quick I found this link :

And I was right! In the plaque it clearly gives us the date *December 17th 1928* or in the format **19281217**.

**Ranking : 162/246**
