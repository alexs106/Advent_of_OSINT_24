# Day 19

Day 19 was quite interesting and introduced me to some new archives I didn't know existed.

Okay so first step is basic general culture.

The main character of *A Christmas Carol* or a grumpy old man who hates Christmas as was written in the 19th century (key to differentiate him from *The Grinch*) is of course :

**Ebenezer Scrooge**

Now this is where it gets tricky...

The short story was adapted to a film, a musical and was broadcasted in French TV Channels during the 90s. 

I had to find on what date this mysterious film was first broadcasted on Canal + ...

I spent hours trying to find what was the film and trying to find hopelessly some sort of tv guide or Canal + archive that had the date.

Finally I read the question again and found this phrase :
*"[...]specialized French institute provides access to this information."*

The only institute I could think of was the **INA** and so I went to their website and found out they have an **INAthèque**.

I filtered the information and just looked up a general *"Scrooge"* and *"Christmas Carol"* movie that was broadcasted *after* 1995 on Canal+*.

*https://catalogue.ina.fr/

Thanks to this I found the correct date for the film named **Scrooge** which was first broadcast on December 16th 1998 or **19981216**.

Now the last answer I found by pure coincidence.

I typed Muonio fishing huts and the first link* had my answer:
**Keimiöniemi**.
