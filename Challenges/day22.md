# Day 22

Okay so day 22, pretty classic.
You have to read what you have an deduce from the information.

So it says the movie came out in France mid February 1996, so two months after it came out in the US.

Which means the premiere in the US was around 15th of December 1995.

I found that the film **Jumanji** was probably the answer.

Then I had to look up the director and see if he had directed one of the first superhero movies in the 90s.

Now *Jumanji's* director was **Joe Johnston**.

He directed in 1991 the movie **The Rocketeer**! 
So there's answer number 1.

Next up, part 2 was a little tricky because you could get confused with multiple names in editing but I followed **Arthur Schmidt**.

He worked in the movie **Back to the Future** in 1985 with director **Robert Zemeckis**.

Now I had to look up a movie that he realised during the 2000s based on a children's book which led me to:
**The Polar Express**.

The author of the original book was **Chris Van Allsburg**.
He wrote a book that was published in 1981 called:
**Jumanji** (Impressive comeback!)

**Ranking : 60/208**
