# Day 6

I still have nightmares about day 6 ...

First question was the worst thing I've ever seen just because of how vague it is which kinda makes it the best.

It says that there is a knight who inspired the story of one of Saint Nichola's companions.

This knight had a castle, in front of his castle, this knight built a tower that acted as an outpost.
What is the name of this tower in it's original language?

What. The. Actual. Fuck.

Even just trying to formulate it is looooong but anyways, it made it interesting.

I'll save you the details but I got confused between all of the companions and different versions of Krampus, Père Fouettard, etc etc 

After a loooooong search of multiple castles and versions of this famous companion I stuck with Hans Trapp aka Le Père Fouettard aka Hans von Trotha.

He had a castle named Berwarstein. 
I looked up a map of the castle and found the name of the tower : **Little France** or in it's original german **Klein-Frankreich**

The second question was easier but also hidden in a dark corner of the internet*. It asked the names of the two saints engraved in Hans von Trotha's stone.

The grave is located in the Chappel of Sainte-Anne and the description says that the names of two saints are engraved in the tombstone :
**Simon and Jude**

**Ranking : 125/472**
