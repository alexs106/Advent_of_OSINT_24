# Day 7

Just as I thought that I was getting the hand of these challenges...Day 7 came.

I started late because it was the weekend, sure but still, this was a hard challenge.

We were given a quote regarding the image that appears on the Earth Day flag :

*"The identity of the photographer is unverifiable? I decided to take that as a personal challenge."*

I googled this phrase and found a website :

http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum29/HTML/000700.html

It comes from Eric Hartwell's InfoDabble (via HobbySpace)*

*http://www.ehartwell.com/Apollo17/

Apparently, this Eric Hartwell had a website with domain name ehartwell.com that isn't online anymore...so I had to use **Wayback Machine** to see the content of the InfoDabble.

Thanks to this, I went to the last version where there was a lot of activity and inside the article regarding Apollo17 we can find the last update was done on Wednesday April 25 2007.

**20070425**

Now...we need to find the amount of photos taken based on the radio exchanges of the astronauts.

In the website, there are examples of the pictures taken, the last picture says #121 so I thought that was the answer but I was wrong.

So I started actually reading the transcript and it says: 

*Schmitt takes the first picture (frame #119, AS17-148-22725)[...] then takes three more photos.*
*S-IVB evasive burn starts (no photo)*
*Cernan didn't get a photo of the S-IVB through the hatch window.*
*He passes the camera to Evans so he can take a parting shot through window 1, but it's too late.*
*Evans reports the frame count. [Note: Frame count is +-1 due to the analog frame counter]*

So the amount of pictures taken must be **122** and it was!

Thanks to this challenge I learned how to use **Wayback Machine**.

**Ranking : 186/285**
