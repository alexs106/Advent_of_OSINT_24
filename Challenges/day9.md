# Day 9

Day 9 is what I like to call a classic beginner OSINT challenge. 
Something that is not obvious but easy enough to find.

I googled *"Code téléphonique mis en service le 15 avril 1945"*.

I found the code used during WWII and at first I decoded it wrong because I thought I had to use the name and not the letter to decode.
The importance of vocabulary in OSINT...

Anyways, after decoding the right message I found the answer : **maquis de Lorris**.

Okay so part 2 was very easy to find, I started looking for an association of the maquis de Lorris and found the **AFAAM**.

Then I had to find the annual commemoration ceremony of 2024 with a simple google search and found, thanks to this link*, the name of the leader of the ensemble:

**Emilie Fleury**

For the second part, based on the date of the annual commemoration which was held on September 15th 2024, I looked up the other performances of the Republican Guard Orchestra from their website*.

I started clicking on every concert post the one from Amilly... maybe there was a smarter way of finding the conductor, but this was my way of thinking.

I found the concert from Saturday 28th of September was also conducted by Emilie Fleury in **Bellême**.

This was the first challenge where I decided to worry about the time and ranking.

**Ranking : 32/379**
