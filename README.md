# Writeups Advent of OSINT 2024

This is my first time doing the **Advent of OSINT** proposed by **OSINT4FUN**. 
In this repo I will disclose my thought process and steps to solving the challenges, hopefully until the last one :)

This was a great opportunity to learn about different types of OSINT challenges and also to learn how to use different tools to solve them like:

-> Image Reverse Search<br/> 
-> Website archives (Wayback Machine for example)<br/> 
-> Who Is websites<br/> 
-> Databases such as Gallica or INAth√®que<br/> 

And many more! 

I can't wait to participate again next year :)
