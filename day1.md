# Day 1

So I started the challenge late because I didn't find out about this advent calendar until the 2nd of December but nonetheless...

The picture given is a watch, it reminded me of an OSINT challenge from the 404CTF 2024 so I knew it wouldn't be too hard.

I started by doing an image reverse search and I found out it was a Seiko watch most likely used in the 1960s or 70s. 

After that things went a little downhill because I thought the answer was supposed to be the date of *manufacture* of the watch (to the exact day) when the question says : 
  *On what date (format YYYYMMDD) did it take off?*

After minutes of searching without finding an answer I realised I was reading this all wrong, all thanks to an article* I found where it says that this watch was used by a famous astronaut... (after pasting the direct question onto Google lol)

So thanks to this article I found out that **Colonel William Pogue** had this watch when he was assigned to a NASA mission in 1973 called **Skylab 4**. 

I could've continued reading the article and found the answer but I decided to just Google "*Take off date of Skylab 4 mission*" and I found the answer : 
**November 16th 1973** or in the format asked **19731116**

Good first challenge to remember the little tweaks about OSINT !
