# Day 3

Okay so...this one was trickier.

A simple image of a pool inside an appartment overlooking a port somewhere.

When I did an image reverse search I immediately found the real estate agency's website* but of course, the website didn't disclose the full address.
The things I found out was that the listing was located in the city of *Cannes*, south of France, in the historic district of *Le Suquet*.

Based on that, I decided to roam Google Maps hoping to find some sort of building that I could recognise from the view of the appartment.

This was harder than I thought, seen as the port is quite big as well as the district so it took me some time to come up with a brilliant idea : *satellite view* (yes it's basic but I didn't think about it before).

Thanks to the satellite view, I started looking for a rooftop with a large enough pool close enough to the port to overlook it and it worked!

I found the street and typed an approximation of the address : **50 rue Louis Perrissol** (the actual answer was 48 but it counted as right).

**Ranking : 72/864**
