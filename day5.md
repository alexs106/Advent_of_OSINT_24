# Day 5

Day 5 was a tricky one...

Okay so first of all, celebrities born on December 5th...
After a simple Google search, I found out that **Walt Disney** was born on December 5th, obbiously his most famous creation was **Mickey Mouse** whose original name was : **Mortimer** (this I know out of basic pop culture).

It's a simple challenge, right? So I thought...

The second question kept me stuck for a while because it's based on speculation...a myth.

>There is much speculation about the date when Mickey Mouse was first conceived. One of the hypotheses mentions the return trip from a disappointing visit to Charles Mintz.
So, according to this theory, on what date (format YYYYMMDD) was Mickey imagined?

I searched **everywhere!**

I found the date around Disney's meetings with Charles Mintz (February 1928) and there was somewhat of a detailed timeline around the whole drama between them but never any specific date... sure the train ride where he supposedly started sketching Mickey Mouse was mentioned but not the exact date so I was growing frustrated.

And then... the holy grail struck and I found this link detailing the date :
**March 13th 1928**

The final question was pretty easy, it just asked what was the title of the first film in which Oswald (the character that Mickey replace) made his appearance in theatres.
Quick Google search gave me the answer : **Trolley Troubles**

**Ranking : 225/527**
